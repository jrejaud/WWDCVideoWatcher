# WWDCVideoWatcher
Chrome extension which lets you watch WWDC Developer Videos in Google Chrome (thus not having to use Safari)

Apple doesn't let you watch it's [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/) videos on any browser except Safari.

![Streaming is available in Safari, and through the WWDC app.](https://github.com/jrejaud/WWDCVideoWatcher/raw/master/blocked_video.tiff "Wtf is this shit?")

I prefer Chrome to Safari, and I don't like being told how I can access information or not.

This extension automatically replaces the video that says "Streaming is available in Safari, and through the WWDC app." with the blocked video itself.
