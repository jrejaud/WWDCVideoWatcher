# WWDChrome
Chrome extension which lets you watch WWDC Developer Videos in Google Chrome (thus not having to use Safari)

Apple doesn't let you watch [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/) videos on any browser except Safari.

![Streaming is available in Safari, and through the WWDC app.](https://github.com/jrejaud/WWDCVideoWatcher/blob/master/blocked_video.png?raw=true "Wtf is this shit?")

This extension automatically replaces the video that says "Streaming is available in Safari, and through the WWDC app." with the blocked video itself.

# Installation

Download the app from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wwdchrome/lohmkcogbijdfgphbioenppfnjfdjebp?hl=en)
